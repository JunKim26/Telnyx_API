# Telnyx_API

In this program, tkinter will be used to prompt a user to choose a csv file that contains phone numbers with the column name "Phone". 
The script will then run a loop that will send an API request to Telnyx to gather information in a JSON format and write a CSV file with the gathered data.
The program will run in loops with a time delay that stays within the API limits.
